# Description
This project is a Python script that converts data into a SQL query. It allows users to quickly and easily convert data into a format that can be used with a SQL database. 

I created this script because I wanted to automate the process explained in [this ticket](https://github.com/jacopotediosi/GoogleDialerMod/issues/51).

This script requires Python 3.x and takes data as a command-line argument. To use the script, run the following command:

 python.exe ./generate_sql.py <input data> <output data>

Where <input data> is the data you wish to convert into a SQL query.
and <output data> is the file that will contains SQL Queries

Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you have any suggestions or find any bugs.
